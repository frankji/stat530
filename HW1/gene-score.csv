ADNP,Activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox,1.1 + S,1S,"Two de novo frameshift variants identified in unrelated simplex ASD cases (PMIDs 22495309 and 23160955). An additional seven de novo LoF variants were recently identified in patients with ASD, giving a current total of nine de novo LoF variants in ADNP gene in ASD cases; probability of detecting eight or more de novo truncating events in ADNP given as P=2.65 x 10-18 in this report.  The frequency of shared clinical characteristics in ASD cases with LoF variants in ADNP (intellectual disability, facial dysmorphisms) led the authors to conclude that ADNP mutations resulted in an autism syndrome (PMID 24531329).  Analysis of rare coding variation in 3,871 ASD cases and 9,937 ancestry-matched or paternal controls from the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC) identified ADNP as a gene meeting high statistical significance with a FDR ???0.01, meaning that this gene had a ???99% chance of being a true autism gene (PMID 25363760).  This gene was identified in Iossifov et al. 2015 as a strong candidate to be an ASD risk gene based on a combination of de novo mutational evidence and the absence or very low frequency of mutations in controls (PMID 26401017).","22495309, 23160955, 24531329, 25363760, 26401017",Sfari

SYNGAP1,synaptic Ras GTPase activating protein 1,1.1 + S,1S,"Several studies have found rare variants in the SYNGAP1 gene to be associated with autism as well as mental retardation and intellectual disability (e.g., PMID 21237447).  More recently, an additional eight de novo LoF variants (either predicted in silico or demonstrated experimentally) in SYNGAP1 have been identified in patients with ASD and intellectual disability with or without epilepsy (PMIDs 23020937, 23708187, and 23161826).  A de novo LoF variant in SYNGAP1 has also been identified in a simplex ASD case from the Simons Simplex Collection (PMID 24267886).  However, a rigorous statistical comparison with controls was not performed in these reports.  Analysis of rare coding variation in 3,871 ASD cases and 9,937 ancestry-matched or paternal controls from the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC) identified SYNGAP1 as a gene meeting high statistical significance with a FDR ???0.01, meaning that this gene had a ???99% chance of being a true autism gene (PMID 25363760).  This gene was identified in Iossifov et al. 2015 as a strong candidate to be an ASD risk gene based on a combination of de novo mutational evidence and the absence or very low frequency of mutations in controls (PMID 26401017).","21237447, 23020937, 23708187, 23161826, 24267886, 25363760, 26401017",Sfari
TAF1,TATA-box binding protein associated factor 1,S,S,"Rare genetic variants involving TAF1 were identified in affected males from 11 families presenting with an X-linked syndrome characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, facial dysmorphic features, generalized hypotonia, and variable neurologic features (O'Rawe et al., 2015); ten of the fourteen probands with TAF1 variants in this report exhibited autistic behaviors.  Variants in this gene had previously been shown to segregate with X-linked intellectual disability in two multi-generational pedigrees (Hu et al., 2015).","26637982, 25644381",Sfari
TCF4,Transcription factor 4,S,S,"Defects in this gene are associated with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) [MIM:610954].  Patients with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome frequently exhibit stereotypic hand and head movements (summarized in Peippo and Ignatius, 2012).  More recently, evaluation of 10 Pitt-Hopkins syndrome patients with psychiatric examinations and neuropsychological measurements using a comprehensive assessment battery, including the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), demonstrated that all participants displayed profound intellectual disability, severe impairments in social interactions, severe impairments in communication and language, and highly frequent stereotyped behavior, indicating that in classic Pitt-Hopkins syndrome the behavioral phenotype showed similarities to behaviors seen in ASD (Van Balkom et al., 2012).  An intronic marker in TCF4 has demonstrated genome-wide association with schizophrenia in case-control meta-analyzes (PMIDs 19571808, 21791550).","22670138, 22712893, 19571808, 21791550",Sfari

UBE3A,ubiquitin protein ligase E3A,4.5 + acc2 + S,3S,"UBE3A is present in common 15q11-13 duplications which involves autism (Glessner et al., 2009; Bucan et al., 2009 and many other references reporting duplication).  Angelman syndrome results predominantly either from de novo 15q11-q13 deletions on the maternal chromosome or mutations in UBE3A.  A number of other rare variants which have been associated with this gene and/or association studies without sufficient statistical significance to warrant elevating the gene.  Schaaf et al., 2011 found novel coding variants but was not statistically strong in a case-control study.  Kim et al., 2008 failed to find association in TdT tests.  Nurmi et al., reported a preliminary study of association (2003).  Veenstra-VanderWeele reported rare variants with resequencing in 1999, but with no case-control sequencing.  A de novo missense variant in UBE3A (p.Thr485Ala) that was identified in a male ASD proband from the Simons Simplex Collection in PMID 25363768 was demonstrated in PMID 26255772 to abolish a phosphorylation site involved in regulating UBE3A activity.  As a result of this variant, mutant UBE3A showed enhanced UBE3A activity in vitro and enhanced substrate turnover, which in turn caused excessive dendritic spine development in vivo.  Increased UBE3A gene dosage in mice resulted in defective social interaction, impaired communication, and increased repetitive stereotypic behavior in PMID 21974935.","19404257, 19557195, 21624971, 18361419, 12851639, 10089011, 25363768, 26255772, 21974935",Sfari

WAC,WW domain containing adaptor with coiled-coil,2.1 + S,2S,"Two de novo LoF variants in the WAC gene (both frameshift) were identified in ASD probands from the Simons Simplex Collection (PMID 25363768).  A third de novo LoF variant in the WAC gene was recently identified in an ASD proband in PMID 26325558.  This gene was identified in Iossifov et al. 2015 as a strong candidate to be an ASD risk gene based on a combination of de novo mutational evidence and the absence or very low frequency of mutations in controls (PMID 26401017).  PMID 26264232 identified de novo LoF variants in WAC in patients with developmental delay.  PMID 26757981 reported additional ID cases with de novo, potentially gene disruptive WAC variants; two of these cases also presented with autism.  Clinical evalution of patients from PMIDs 26264232 and 26757981 revealed phenotypic overlap consisting of developmental delay/intellectual disability, hypotonia, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial dysmorphism, possibly defining a novel form of syndromic intellectual disability.  Similar clinical features have been reported in individuals with 10p12-p11 microdeletion syndrome, for which the shortest deleted region contains two genes, WAC and BAMBI.","25363768, 26325558, 26401017, 26264232, 26757981",Sfari
ZBTB20,Zinc finger and BTB domain containing 20,3.3 + S,3S,"Missense variants in the ZBTB20 gene were recently identified in eight patients diagnosed with Primrose syndrome; seven of these variants were de novo in origin, and six of these variants were experimentally shown to have functional effects (i.e. reduced promoter binding and impaired function in repressing reporter expression) in a dominant-negative manner.  These missense variants were not observed in public or in-house databases.  Two of the patients diagnosed with Primrose syndrome that carried de novo functional missense variants were reported in the supplementary material as also presenting with autism (PMID 25017102).
